# An Abridged History of Neverwinter

***-10 DR***. Lord Halueth Never, a sun elf, settles the area in his conquest of Illusk. Construction of Castle Never begins. {.no-fancy}

***87 DR***. The settlement of "Eigersstor" is founded around Castle Never. A later translation to Chondathan would name this settlement "Neverwinter".

***457 DR***. The School of Wizardry is founded in Neverwinter by the wizards Aganazzar, Ilyykur, Presper, and Grimwald (collectively known as The Covenant). 

***955 DR***. Red Wizards of Thay aid orc hordes in escaping the wizards of Neverwinter, starting the "Orcgates Affair" and a centuries-long feud between Thay and Neverwinter.

***1081 DR***. Red Wizards slay Aganazzar and destroy the School of Wizardry.

***1329 DR***. Nasher Alagondar becomes king of Neverwinter.

***1372 DR***. An illness befalls Neverwinter that kills most of its residents within ten days of onset. It becomes known as the "Wailing Death".

***1379 DR***. The Shadovar attack Moonshadow Hall and send one of its towers to The Shadowfell. In a few years it will appear in Neverwinter as the floating Shard of Night.

***1385 DR***. The Spellplague strikes Toril. This creates the floating earthmotes on which some of Neverwinter's landmarks reside, sends the Cloak Tower to the Far Realm, causes the rise of undead in the Neverdeath graveyard, allows the Netherese to transport the Shard of Night to Neverwinter, and corrupts the Underdark directly beneath Neverwinter (which gets exposed as the Chasm later).

***1451 DR***. An adventuring party in Gauntlgrym caused the primordial Maegera to fly into a fit of rage and lay waste to much of the surrounding area. This included causing Mount Hotenow to erupt, opening a massive chasm in the south-eastern quarter of Neverwinter and laying ruin to much of Castle Never (killing most of the castle's inhabitants as well). This event is often simply referred to as "The Cataclysm."

***1467 DR***. Still reeling from the destruction of the cataclysm, Dagult Neverember hires Mintarn mercenaries to aid him in bringing order back to Neverwinter. He calls this the "New Neverwinter" movement.

***1474 DR***. The Sons of Alagondar are formed as a nationalist group opposed to Dagult Neverember's rule of Neverwinter. They have two factions, The Nashers and The Graycloaks. The Nashers are more violent in their attempt to remove Neverember, whereas the Graycloaks tend to use politics and subterfuge to depose Neverember.

***1479 DR***. Seldra Tylmarande is given a replica of the Crown of Neverwinter. She uses the fake crown, along with a male disguise, to try to make claim to the throne of Neverwinter and depose Neverember. She is defeated and the plot fails. Neverember also claims he is a legitimate heir to the throne but is unable to find a real crown and prove it.

***1479 DR***. Selûne intervenes in mortal affairs and sends shards to Toril that allow Lady Jasmine and other selûnite priestesses (with the help of adventurers) to cleanse the Shard of Night into the Shard of the Moon.

***1479 DR***. Elden Vargas, a powerful War Wizard from Cormyr, sends a good portion of Neverwinter's populace into madness in a plot to rescue his wife that is being held in Helm's Hold by Ashmadai cultists' attempt to exploit the mage. The conflict results in demons and cultists attacking the Beached Leviathan.

***1486 DR***. The Chasm is sealed, but at great expense to the city of Neverwinter.

***1489 DR***. Lord Neverember is ousted as Open Lord of Waterdeep and can focus his attention more exclusively on Neverwinter.
